# BUAS programming Application

## Sources
This project uses a simple physics based game engine I created which can be found here: https://github.com/Raine-Rodgers/Physics-Engine-Template.
Any resources I used for the creation of the engine will be found in the readme of that repo.
All textures used where created by me with the license of free private usage

## How to play
I have chosen to take the theme "Collide" to create a mini golf inspired game which has very simple controls.

Please Press the button title "Play".
You will find another button however this one currently does not have a function.

Hold the mouse over your character, the red circle likely found near the bottom of the screen, and then left click and hold.
You can now charge up your shot by pulling your mouse backwards in the opposite direction that you want the ball to travel.
The direct of travel will be shown by a red arrow which will also be a help to judge the force you're putton on the ball.
Now release the mouse button to fire the ball in the desired direction.
Try to get the ball to intersect the White circle found somewhere within the map.

After you have completed 3 levels varying in difficulty you will be shown a congradulations message and your final amount of shots required to get here.

You can press the escape key or manually close the window at any point
